Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.   The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.   The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",One-time,NYC Department of Education,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-07-Class-Size-By-Borough/4g4r-7dfb,Education,dataset,tabular,22703.0,22.7 KB,2011-10-13

365,5i9t-mvdt,NYC Independent Budget Office  Debt Outstanding Since FY,711,2191,"Amount of debt outstanding as of June 30 of each year.  SOURCES: IBO; New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (various years) NOTES: 1In determining what to include as outstanding debt of the City of New York, IBO considered: (1) the city's obligation (contractual and moral) to repay the debt, (2) whether the revenues pledged toward the repayment of the debt would have otherwise accrued to the city, and (3) whether the proceeds of the debt issuance accrue directly to the city. 2GO debt is net of bonds held for debt service on other city-related obligations, referred to in the Comptroller's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as Treasury Obligations. The 2000–2002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively. However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward. 3Fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively. 4For fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly.  5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008 														 General Obligation: General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city. City property tax collections are pledged first to pay the principal and interest on these bonds. 														 														 Treasury Obligations: Treasury obligations are New York City bonds held as investments by the city or by the related entities covered here, including MAC and SFC. They are netted out in order to avoid double counting of the city's obligations. 														 Transitional Finance Authority: Created in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit. 														 TFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds: In fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan. 														 TSASC: TSASC Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and participating manufacturers. 														 Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York: The Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in 2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a default of city general obligation bonds. MAC bonds were secured by state collections of certain sales and compensating use taxes (imposed by the state within the city at rates formerly imposed by the city), the stock transfer tax, and certain per capita state aid. 														 Samurai Funding Corporation: The Samurai Funding Corporation (SFC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, which issued Japanese yen-denominated bonds. The yen-denominated bonds were secured by the proceeds of New York City general obligation bonds held by SFC. 														 Conduit Debt: The city makes annual appropriations from its general fund for agreements with other entities that issue debt to build or maintain facilities on behalf of the city. These agreements are known as ""leaseback"" transactions, where the city makes rental payments to the partner entity in an amount sufficient to pay the entity's debt service on the securities issued for the respective capital expenditures. These entities, though legally separate from the city, either provide services exclusively to the city, have governance boards whose majority is appointed by the city, or are otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on the activities of the entity. 														 Excluded Items: IBO considered several other items for inclusion as outstanding debt of the City of New York that were ultimately determined not to constitute obligations of the city, including: outstanding bonds of the Fiscal Year 2005 Securitization Corporation (FSC), outstanding bonds of the Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STAR), notes of the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (HYIC), and general capital lease obligations. 														 FSC is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to acquire securities, held in escrow, which economically defeased city general obligation bonds. As the general obligation bonds in question are included in the calculation of outstanding general obligation debt, the inclusion of the FSC bonds as well would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count FSC debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding. 														 STAR is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to assume the remaining obligations of MAC. STAR pays the debt service on these bonds with revenues received from the Local Government Assistance Corporation, a state entity whose revenues are 1 percent of the statewide sales tax. The debt of STAR is not an obligation of the city, and the revenues used to pay STAR debt service would not accrue to the city in the corporation's absence. As such, IBO does not count STAR debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding. 														 HYIC entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to purchase from the MTA Transferrable Development Rights.  $200 million of notes were issued by HYIC, the proceeds of which were used to execute the transaction. Debt service on the notes was paid from the proceeds of the bonds issued by HYIC which are included in IBO's definition of outstanding debt under conduit debt.  Therefore, inclusion in outstanding debt of the notes in addition to the bonds would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count HYIC notes outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding. 														 In addition to the capital leases deemed to be debt obligations of the city under conduit debt, various city agencies have entered into leases that have been determined under generally accepted accounting practices to be capital leases. Unlike issuers of conduit debt, the lessors of these general lease obligations do not exist to provide services exclusively to the city, do not have boards the majority of whose members are appointed by the city, or are not otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on their activities. These general capital lease obligations do not constitute an obligation of the city toward any bonds or other borrowing. As such, IBO does not count general capital lease obligations toward total New York City debt outstanding. .",Annually,NYC Independent Budget Office (IBO),https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Independent-Budget-Office-IBO-Debt-Outstanding/5i9t-mvdt,City Government,dataset,tabular,3612.0,3.61 KB,2021-06-18

NYC Parks calculates the number of New Yorkers within walking distance of a park and reports on this as part of the Mayor’s Management Report. “Walking distance” is defined as a 1/4-mile or less for sites such as small playgrounds and sitting areas; or a 1/2-mile or less for larger parks that serve a wider region, typically over 8 acres or situated on the waterfront. Certain properties in NYC Parks' portfolio, such as cemeteries, community gardens, or sites with no recreational equipment were not included in this analysis. Similarly, some parks and open-space amenities not under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks were included in this analysis, as they provide recreational value.  This dataset includes two ESRI shapefiles of access points, one for sites that get a 1/4-mile buffer and one for sites that get a 1/2-mile buffer. It also includes an ESRI shapefile of the combined polygon that is the output of this analysis. This polygon represents the total area within walking distance of a park. To generate the number of New Yorkers within that distance, the polygon is compared with data from the U.S. Census.  This information is only current as of the publication date.

The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.</br>  (2) New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years' debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year.</br>  (3) The defeasance of $536 million of GO bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

487,6qs8-44ki,DOHMH COVID-19 Antibody-by-Modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area,49,38,"This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people,  stratified by modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) of residence. Modified ZCTA reflects the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result. This unit of geography is similar to ZIP codes but combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation. It can be challenging to map data that are reported by ZIP Code. A ZIP Code doesn’t refer to an area, but rather a collection of points that make up a mail delivery route. Furthermore, there are some buildings that have their own ZIP Code, and some non-residential areas with ZIP Codes. To deal with the challenges of ZIP Codes, the Health Department uses ZCTAs which solidify ZIP codes into units of area. Often, data reported by ZIP code are actually mapped by ZCTA. The ZCTA geography was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-modzcta.csv  Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person’s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level. </br> These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City;  therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.  In addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders)  Rates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning.   Antibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.  Data are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates. </br> For further details, visit: •	https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page •	https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data •	https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Modified-Zip-Code-Tabulation-Areas-MODZCTA-/pri4-ifjk",Daily,Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH),https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DOHMH-COVID-19-Antibody-by-Modified-ZIP-Code-Tabul/6qs8-44ki,Missing,dataset,tabular,20424.0,20.42 KB,2021-12-17

595,7piy-bhr9,NYC Wetlands Map,148,0,"In 2016 NYC Parks contracted with the UVM Spatial Analysis Lab to use modern remote sensing and object-based image analysis to create a new wetlands map for New York City. Data inputs include Light Detection and Ranging Data, State and Federal Wetland Inventories, soils, and field data. Because the map was conservative in its wetlands predictions, NYC Parks staff improved the map through a series of desktop and field verification efforts. From June to November 2020, NYC Parks staff field verified the majority of wetlands on NYC Parks' property.   The map will be opportunistically updated depending on available field information and delineations. Another dedicated field verification effort has not been planned. As of June 2021, no subsequent updates to the data are scheduled.   Original field names were updated to field names that are easier to understand.   This dataset was developed to increase awareness regarding the location and extent of wetlands to promote restoration and conservation in New York City. This map does not supersede U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) wetlands maps and has no jurisdictional authority. It should be used alongside NWI and NYSDEC datasets as a resource for identifying likely locations of wetlands in New York City. Mapped features vary in the confidence of their verification status, ranging from ""Unverified"" (meaning the feature exists in its original remotely mapped form and has not been ground truthed) to ""Verified - Wetland Delineation"" (meaning the boundaries and type of wetland have been verified during an official wetland delineation). Because of the rapid nature of the protocol and the scale of data collection, this product is not a subsitute for on-site investigations and field delineations. The dataset also includes broad classifications for each wetland type, e.g. estuarine, emergent wetland, forested wetland, shrub/scrub wetland, or water. Cowardin classifcations were not used given rapid verfication methods.   The accuracy of the wetlands map has improved over time as a result of the verification process. Fields were added over time as necessitated by the workflow and values were updated with information, either from the field verifications, delineation reports, or desktop analysis.

1003,bhau-5xgs,DOHMH COVID-19 Antibody-by-Sex,48,38,"This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people,  stratified by sex. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-sex.csv    Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person’s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.  These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City; therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.  In addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)  Rates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning.   Antibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.  Data are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates.  For further details, visit: •	https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page •	https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data",Daily,Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH),https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DOHMH-COVID-19-Antibody-by-Sex/bhau-5xgs,Missing,dataset,tabular,152.0,152 bytes,2021-12-17

1022,bm4k-52h4,Motor Vehicle Collisions - Vehicles,5749,2179,"The Motor Vehicle Collisions vehicle table contains details on each vehicle involved in the crash. Each row represents a motor vehicle involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system. </p> The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details. </p> Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.

NTAs were delineated with the need for both geographic specificity and statistical reliability in mind. Consequently, each NTA contains enough population to mitigate sampling error associated with the ACS yet offers a unit of analysis that is smaller than a Community District.  Though NTA boundaries and their associated names roughly correspond with many neighborhoods commonly recognized by New Yorkers, NTAs are not intended to definitively represent neighborhoods, nor are they intended to be exhaustive of all possible names and understandings of neighborhoods throughout New York City.

1134,cqhz-kkvd,DOHMH COVID-19 Antibody-by-Week,39,42,"This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people, stratified by week of testing. </br> These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/antibody-by-week.csv     Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person’s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level. These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City;  therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.  In addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)  Rates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning.   Antibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.  Data are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates.   For further details, visit: •	https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page •	https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data",Daily,Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH),https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DOHMH-COVID-19-Antibody-by-Week/cqhz-kkvd,Missing,dataset,tabular,3477.0,3.48 KB,2021-12-16

Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system. </p> The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details. </p> Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",Daily,Police Department (NYPD),https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu,Public Safety,dataset,tabular,740652099.0,740.65 MB,2021-12-17

The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the <a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page"" style=""color:#187bcd;"">NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page</a> (updated weekly) or <a href=""http://www.nycvzv.info/"" style=""color:#187bcd;"">Vision Zero View</a> (updated monthly).  </p> Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",Daily,Police Department (NYPD),https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95,Public Safety,dataset,tabular,395636531.0,395.64 MB,2021-12-16

Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.   The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.   The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",One-time,NYC Department of Education,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-07-Class-Size-By-District/nwrb-z58j,Education,dataset,tabular,65098.0,65.1 KB,2011-10-13

2289,p48c-iqtu,NYC Wetlands,153,35,"In 2016 NYC Parks contracted with the UVM Spatial Analysis Lab to use modern remote sensing and object-based image analysis to create a new wetlands map for New York City. Data inputs include Light Detection and Ranging Data, State and Federal Wetland Inventories, soils, and field data. Because the map was conservative in its wetlands predictions, NYC Parks staff improved the map through a series of desktop and field verification efforts. From June to November 2020, NYC Parks staff field verified the majority of wetlands on NYC Parks' property.   The map will be opportunistically updated depending on available field information and delineations. Another dedicated field verification effort has not been planned. As of June 2021, no subsequent updates to the data are scheduled.   Original field names were updated to field names that are easier to understand.   This dataset was developed to increase awareness regarding the location and extent of wetlands to promote restoration and conservation in New York City. This map does not supersede U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) wetlands maps and has no jurisdictional authority. It should be used alongside NWI and NYSDEC datasets as a resource for identifying likely locations of wetlands in New York City. Mapped features vary in the confidence of their verification status, ranging from ""Unverified"" (meaning the feature exists in its original remotely mapped form and has not been ground truthed) to ""Verified - Wetland Delineation"" (meaning the boundaries and type of wetland have been verified during an official wetland delineation). Because of the rapid nature of the protocol and the scale of data collection, this product is not a subsitute for on-site investigations and field delineations. The dataset also includes broad classifications for each wetland type, e.g. estuarine, emergent wetland, forested wetland, shrub/scrub wetland, or water. Cowardin classifcations were not used given rapid verfication methods.   The accuracy of the wetlands map has improved over time as a result of the verification process. Fields were added over time as necessitated by the workflow and values were updated with information, either from the field verifications, delineation reports, or desktop analysis.

This study builds on decades of research and analysis into the evolving composition of NYC's waste stream. The study team hand sorted samples into 70 main sort categories. Sub-sorting of an additional 172 categories was conducted to get a more detailed understanding of the wide variety of plastic products in the waste stream, as well as a sub-set of Paper products. Results are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type. The quantity of each materials is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total quantity of DSNY collections for fiscal year 2017 (July 2016-June 2017).  </p> The residential characterization included four residential curbside collection streams: Refuse, Paper, MGP (metal/glass/plastic), and Organics.  The school characterization included Refuse, Paper, and MGP streams collected on dedicated school collection routes.

MTI activities blend academics and physical activity into educational lessons that support New York State PE Learning Standards and are integrated with Common Core Learning Standards.  The MTI program is free and includes benefits and incentives for students, teachers, principals, and schools. MTI activities are inclusive and designed to enhance academic learning during classroom instruction. A growing body of research suggests that student success depends on a combination of academic skills, healthy lifestyle, and physical and mental fitness. Specifically, in NYC, the correlation between fitness levels and academic achievement has been shown: http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/survey/survey-2009fitnessgram.pdf  MTI All-Star school  Schools with a comprehensive PE program, led by a certified or designated PE teacher, have the opportunity to become an MTI All-Star school by training at least 85% of their eligible teachers in MTI.  New York State requires all elementary schools to provide at least 120 minutes of PE every week for all students. MTI All-Star schools can use MTI activities during classroom instructional time to supplement their existing PE program to meet this requirement.  MTI All-Star schools receive MTI implementation guidance and Citywide recognition of MTI best practices  All NYC district public schools with classroom teachers serving grades K-5 are eligible to participate in the MTI program.  For the 2016-2017 school year, elementary schools can participate in MTI in two ways:  1) MTI Train-the-Trainer  - Certified or designated PE teachers from district public elementary schools can attend an MTI Train-the-Trainer (TTT) session where they will learn to become MTI trainers for their school.  - TTT sessions are offered during school hours so PE teachers will need to be released to attend.  2) MTI Event  - K-5 classroom teachers (including cluster, PE, and special education) from district public schools can register for an open MTI workshop session offered citywide.  - Participating teachers receive UFT negotiated training rate (for after-school hours) and a certificate of completion (can count towards the 175 hours of professional development; contingent on principal’s approval).""",One-time,Other,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2015-2016-MTI-All-Star-Schools/pqbh-p6xe,Education,dataset,tabular,5748.0,5.75 KB,2017-06-26

The 2005 study also included a characterization of the contents of street litter baskets.  </p> The 2013 study surveyed residential curbside Paper, MGP, and Refuse collections providing statistical results by borough for the City as a whole, but not by housing density and income levels. The 2013 study also included a detailed characterization of discarded plastics, as well as food and beverage containers.  </p> The 2017 study followed the same methodology for residential curbside collections as the 2013 study but included residential curbside collection of organics waste (Organics), NYC's new service to recycle food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard waste.

2977,vajk-p37e,DOHMH COVID-19 Antibody-by-Neighborhood Poverty,73,35,"This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people, stratified by ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) neighborhood poverty group. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-poverty.csv    Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person’s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.  These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City; therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.  In addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)  Neighborhood-level poverty groups were classified in a manner consistent with Health Department practices to describe and monitor disparities in health in NYC. Neighborhood poverty measures are defined as the percentage of people earning below the Federal Poverty Threshold (FPT) within a ZCTA. The standard cut-points for defining categories of neighborhood-level poverty in NYC are: •	Low: <10% of residents in ZCTA living below the FPT •	Medium: 10% to <20% •	High: 20% to <30% •	Very high: ≥30% residents living below the FPT The ZCTAs used for classification reflect the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result.  Rates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. Rates for poverty were calculated using direct standardization for age at diagnosis and weighting by the US 2000 standard population. Antibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.  Data are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates.

Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.   The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.   The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",One-time,NYC Department of Education,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-07-Class-Size-By-Region/weaz-wxw9,Education,dataset,tabular,22129.0,22.13 KB,2011-10-13

Cardozo initiated the Public Service Program - a private/public partnership with the City's prominent law firms, where firms either lend their attorneys to the Law Department for a finite period of time or agree to take on City cases in-house. The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public.  Trial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments. Law Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials. Deposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.",Annually,Law Department (LAW),https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/LAW-Public-Service-Program/yk6f-pa7p,City Government,dataset,tabular,1673.0,1.67 KB,2013-06-21
