## Group15 Metavis: Connect Datasets for Better Analysis

_Guangyu Wu, Shiyue Liu & Zhengyi Chen_

With the proliferation of open data platforms and free visualization tools, analysts have gone from a state of data scarcity to information overload. In face of the growing dataverses, the traditional paradigm of searching falls short in two aspects. If you do not know a dataset exists or have not realized its relevance, you cannot search for it. Secondly, search results show datasets as standalone objects, missing out the opportunity of linking datasets together to solve complex problems. In this project, we build MetaVis, a metadata-based recommendation engine that helps users navigate dataverse through mixed initiative exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of MetaVis through a use case of NYC Open Data.

There are two main folders:
1. metavis_app: code to generate Metavis app and some static data files.
2. recommendation_algorithm_notebooks: moduls of recommendation systems in the format of jupyter notebooks.
